### Graphical Representation of Continuous Time Homogeneous Markov Chain:
A [[DES - Definition of 'Transition Function Matrix for CTHMC'|CTHMC]] ($\mathcal{X}, \ Q, \ \Pi_0$) is represented by a **direct**, **labeled graph** such that:
- The nodes are the states of the CTHMC
- There is an arc from the state $i$ to the state $j \neq i$ with label $q_{i,j}$ if and only if $q_{i,j} > 0$
