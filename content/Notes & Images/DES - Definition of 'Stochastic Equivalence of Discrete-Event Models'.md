So given 2 [[DES - Definition of 'Stochastic Timed Automata'|stochastic timed automata]] $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ , described by two 6-tuples $\left(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{X}, \Gamma, p, p_{x_{0}}, F\right)$.
To be stochastically equivalent they have to have the same $\left(\mathcal{X}, \ p, \ p_{x_0}, \ F \right)$
And can have different: $\left(\mathcal{E}, \ \Gamma \right)$ (state set and possible state of events in state $x$)
