### Steady-State Conditions for Queuing Systems:
List of knowledge needed for this page:
- [[DES - Analysis of Queuing Networks|Definition]] of $S_q$ : **system time of costumer $q$**.
- [[DES - Definition of 'State of a System'|Definition]] of $X(t)$: **state at time t** which being in a queuing system will also describe the number of customers in the system.

> **NOTE**:
> $X$ and $S$ are defined as show in this page, such as the **limits** of **system time** and **system state**
> 
> We can use this limits to forget about the dependency of the system with time, saying: 
> "_At steady state the average number of customer in the system will be E$[X]$ and each customer will stay in the system E$[S]$ seconds/minutes/hours/... (it depends on how you declare $S_q$)_"
