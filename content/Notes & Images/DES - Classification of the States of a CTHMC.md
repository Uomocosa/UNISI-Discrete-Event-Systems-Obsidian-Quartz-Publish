### Classification of the States of a CTHMC:
Recall the definition of [[DES - Definition of 'Transition Function Matrix for CTHMC'|transition functions matrix]]:
$$
p_{i,j}(t) \triangleq P(X(s+t) = j \mid X(s) = i)
$$
Which is **independent** of $s$

Then a state $x \in \mathcal{X}$ can be defined:
- [[DES - Definition of 'Reachable State'|Reachable]]
- In a [[DES - Definition of 'Closed Subset'|Closed Subset]]
- In an [[DES - Definition of 'Irreducible Subset'|Irreducible Subset]]
- [[DES - Definition of 'Recurrent State or Transient State'|Transient or Recurrent]]

###### Irreducible CTHMC:
The CTHMC is said **irreducible** if the state set $\mathcal{X}$ is **irreducible**
