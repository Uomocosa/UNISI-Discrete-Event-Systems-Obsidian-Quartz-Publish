### Continuous Time Homogeneous Markov Chains:
A **continuous-time homogeneous Markov** [[DES - Definition of 'Chain'|Chain]] is a stochastic process such that:
- the time set $\mathcal{T}$ is **continuous**, typically $\mathcal{T} = \mathbb{R}^{\ge 0}$
- the state set $\mathcal{X}$ is **discrete**, typically $\mathcal{X} = \{1, \ 2, \ 3, \ \ldots\}$
- the [[DES - Definition of 'Markov Process'|Markov property]] holds.
- the [[DES - Definition of 'Homogeneity'|homogeneity]] holds.
