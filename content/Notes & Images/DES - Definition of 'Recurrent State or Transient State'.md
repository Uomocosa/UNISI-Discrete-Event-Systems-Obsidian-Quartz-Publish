### Transient or Recurrent State:
Consider the following problem:
The system is in state $i \in \mathcal{X}$, and a transition to another state $j \neq i$ occurs.

_Will the system surely return to state $i$ in the future?_
- Consider the "future" as infinity time from the state change.

If the answer is **yes**, the state $i$ is said **Recurrent**
Otherwise, it is said **Transient**
