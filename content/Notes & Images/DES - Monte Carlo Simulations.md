### Monte Carlo Simulation
The Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows people to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making. 

Monte Carlo simulation furnishes the decision-maker with a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action. 

###### History
The technique was first used by scientists working on the atom bomb; it was named for Monte Carlo, the Monaco resort town renowned for its casinos. Since its introduction in World War II, Monte Carlo simulation has been used to model a variety of physical and conceptual systems

### How Monte Carlo Simulation Works:
Monte Carlo simulation performs risk analysis by building models of possible results by substituting a range of values (a [[DES - (PDF) Probability Distribution Function|probability distribution]]) for any factor that has inherent uncertainty. 

It then calculates results over and over, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions. 

Depending upon the number of uncertainties and the ranges specified for them, a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of recalculations before it is complete.

> Monte Carlo simulation produces distributions of possible outcome values.

By using probability distributions, variables can have different probabilities of different outcomes occurring. Probability distributions are a much more realistic way of describing uncertainty in variables of a risk analysis.
