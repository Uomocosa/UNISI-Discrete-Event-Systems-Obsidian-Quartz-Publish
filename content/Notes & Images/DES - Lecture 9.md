# Introduction to Poisson Clock Structure
The premise of the stochastic timed automata with Poisson Clock Structure is a review of the [[DES - Exponential Distribution|exponential distribution]].

Also do not forget:
- [[DES - Definition of 'Expected Value']]
- [[DES - Definition of 'Variance']]

The exponential distribution is renowned because it is the **==only== continuous distribution** enjoying the [[DES - Definition of 'Memory-Less Property'|memory-less property]].
- [[DES - Demonstration on the Memory-Less Property of the Exponential Distribution]]

But we will need an extend version of the memory-less property for the exponential distribution:
- [[DES - Definition of 'Extended Memory-Less Property']]

Then let's define the [[DES - Definition of 'Superposition'|superposition]].
